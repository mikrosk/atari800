This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o similarly create common sound.[ch] routines

o sound recording should store the sound in the .WAV format and should
  be available on all platforms (not only X11)

o finally merge the ALLEGRO and plain DOS versions - digital sound is in
  the plain DOS now so just take the joystick and sound card initialization
  from ALLEGRO and you're done

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it will be usable on all platforms.

o simplify and correct synchronization code in main emulator loop - some
  people still complain that the emulator is slower than the original Atari.

o update the m68k assembler version of cpu.c

o clean up the source and start using GNU autoconfig stuff
