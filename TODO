This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff into 
  one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it will be usable on all platforms.

o simplify and correct synchronization code in main emulator loop - some
  people still complain that the emulator is slower than the original Atari.

o update atari_vga.c so it's compilable using latest GCC 2.95 and Allegro 3.12

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o enable digitised sound in the non-Allegro DOS port (Allegro version of A800
  already does support the digitised sound). The same applies to keyclick sound.

o fix all known bugs (see BUGS file)
