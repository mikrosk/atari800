This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------
o merge common parts of VGA, SVGALIB and AtariFalcon keyboard stuff
  into one source file named like atari_keyboard.c.

o sound recording should store the sound in the .WAV format and should
  be available on all platforms (not only X11)

o draw_display should be supported on all platforms (remove the kludge in
  the Falcon port)

o finally merge the ALLEGRO and plain DOS versions - digital sound is in
  the plain DOS now so just take the joystick and sound card initialization
  from ALLEGRO and you're done

o rewrite joycfg to use curses so it will be usable on all platforms.

o simplify and correct synchronization code in main emulator loop - some
  people still complain that the emulator is slower than the original Atari.

o update the m68k assembler version of cpu.c

o replace #ifdef _alpha_ with something like #ifdef 64BIT and update
  Makefile/config.h so it defines 64BIT for all 64bit architectures

o clean up the source and start using GNU autoconfig stuff

o fix all known bugs (see BUGS file)
