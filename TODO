This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o POKEY timers

o speed the emulator up
