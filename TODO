This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o enable digitised sound in the non-Allegro DOS port (Allegro version of A800
  already does support the digitised sound). The same applies to keyclick sound.

o fix all known bugs (see BUGS file)
