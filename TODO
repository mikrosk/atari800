This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o enable artifacting in all architectures (not only Win32). Use -artifact
  or similar command line switch.

o ADDLOG should become the standard for reporting errors (all printf() should
  be removed and replaced with ADDLOG). Then define ADDLOG for every
  architecture (for Unices it might still use just printf, but Falcon and DOS
  will list the error report after switching back to text mode).
  My BACKUP_MSG kludge should be replaced with ADDLOG as well. Perhaps also
  delayed_vga_init() from Perry could be removed thanks to that.

o A new feature that would allow user to "freeze" the emulated program,
  save everything to disk and later restore the emulator in the same state.
  Idea invented by Rich so he hopefully will write the code as well :-)

o enable digitised sound in the 'official' DOS port (Makefile.pm already does
  support the digitised sound). The same applies to keyclick sound.

o move the keyboard emulation of joy to cursor keys (fire to Ctrl and/or Alt)
  and/or emulate two joysticks on the same keyboard. Though keep the current
  state, the new features enable with a command switch

o fix all known bugs (see BUGS file)
