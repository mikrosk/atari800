This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o A new feature that would allow user to "freeze" the emulated program,
  save everything to disk and later restore the emulator in the same state.
  Idea invented by Rich so he hopefully will write the code as well :-)

o enable digitised sound in the non-Allegro DOS port (Allegro version of A800
  already does support the digitised sound). The same applies to keyclick sound.

o fix all known bugs (see BUGS file)
