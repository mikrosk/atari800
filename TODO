This is a list of things that need to be done
---------------------------------------------

o The obsolete variable "countdown_rate" is still in use within
  "atari_amiga.c" this should be a trivial change, however I'm reluctant
  to do it without an Amiga to check it. I've left it defined in "atari.c"
  so that there are no linker errors on the Amiga.

o POKEY timers

o speed the emulator up

Special TODO for 0.9.2:
-----------------------

o enable artifacting in all architectures (not only Win32). Use -artifact
  or similar command line switch.

o ADDLOG should become the standard for reporting errors (all printf() should
  be removed and replaced with ADDLOG). Then define ADDLOG for every
  architecture (for Unices it might still use just printf, but Falcon and DOS
  will list the error report after switching back to text mode).
  My BACKUP_MSG kludge should be replaced with ADDLOG as well. Perhaps also
  delayed_vga_init() from Perry could be removed (it's on Perry).
